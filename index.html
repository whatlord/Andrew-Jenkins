			<h2>Hi! I'm Andrew.</h2>
			<p>I am a web developer and software engineer based in the Houston, Texas area</p>
			<br>
			<p>I want to make websites and write programs that: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Bring people together</li>
				<li>Make people happy</li>
				<li>Fun and easy to understand</li>
				<li>Refined and beautiful</li>
			</ol>

		<div id ="about">
			<article>
				<p>My love of programming started when I was in high school. I took all the Computer Science classes my
				school had to offer and pursued my coding interests outside of school as well. After high school, I worked 
				in a sales and marketing firm as a new hire, then as a manager and trainer.</p>
				<p>After wetting my feet in the career field, I returned to college and recieved my Associate Degree in
				Computer Science in just a year and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I joined
				Thinkful's bootcamp program to get a jumpstart on my career while I'm still working on my degree.</p>
				<p>If you're looking for a new hire, please feel free to reach out! I am always looking for new opportunities
				to grow and work with other web developers.</p>
